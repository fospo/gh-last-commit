# Last GitHub Commit
This Python script retrieves the latest commit for each repository of a specified GitHub organization.

## Usage
1. Set your GH_TOKEN environment variable with your GitHub personal access token.

```bash
export GH_TOKEN=your_github_token
```

2. Run the script with the organization name and the file name as arguments. The file should contain the names of the repositories, one per line.

```bash
python last_commit.py organization_name file_name
```

The script will create a `results.csv` file with the repository names, the date of the last commit, and the author of the last commit. If a repository has no commits, "No commits found" will be printed.
